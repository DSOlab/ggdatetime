# ggdatetime C++ library
==============================================================================

ggdatetime is a C++ library to assist Geodesy and GNSS-processing related
fields.

## Prerequisites
==============================================================================

* C++ standards:
tested under C++14 and C++17

* Compilers
tested under g++

## Installation
==============================================================================

Production Version
------------------
To build the "production" version, follow the "standard procedure", aka
(in the ROOT_DIR) type the following commands:
$> ./configure ## (run configure placed in ROOTDIR)
$> make all
$> sudo make install

The library will be placed under /usr/local/lib, as
libggdatetime.a (dynamic version)
libggdatetime.so (static version)

Note that you have to update/add the above path to be able to link against the
library. This can be done in a number of ways, e.g. have your system
administrator add /usr/local/lib to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

Debug Version
-------------
To build the "debug" version, you will need to re-make the Makefile.in files
(in ROOTDIR/src and ROOTDIR/test). To do this, you will need to use the
Makefile.am.debug files, under ROOTDIR/src and ROOTDIR/test.
So, rename these files to Makefile.am
$> mv ROOTDIR/src/Makefile.am.debug ROOTDIR/src/Makefile.am
$> mv ROOTDIR/test/Makefile.am.debug ROOTDIR/test/Makefile.am

Run autoreconf -i to produce the respective, new, Makefile.in files.
(Note that autoreconf is part of Autotools package; you may have to install this
package)
$> autoreconf -i

Now follow the the "standard procedure", aka
(in the ROOT_DIR) type the following commands:
$> ./configure ## (run configure placed in ROOTDIR)
$> make all
$> sudo make install

Note that you only need the "debug" version if you want to mess with the code.

Verification
-------------
After a successeful installation, you should be able to run the test program
ROOTDIR/test/testDatetime
